    <h1>When We First Met</h1>

    <p>
      It didn’t start loud.<br>
      It started soft.<br><br>

      Just conversations that felt easy,<br>
      chats that lasted longer than planned,<br>
      and smiles we didn’t notice forming.<br><br>

      Somewhere between the texts and fast replies,<br>
      it started feeling magical.<br><br>

      Like we were meant to find each other,<br>
      even before we knew why.
