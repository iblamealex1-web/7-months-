    Happy 7 month anniversary baby.<br><br>

    Long journey from the Hi Hello to love you and fights,
    we came a long way. I love you Tito.<br><br>

    Sometimes things may feel hard and stuff gets really messed up,
    but we love each other and make things really good.<br><br>

    From Titiksha to Tito it’s been a great journey and the happiest
    7 months of my life.<br><br>

    We had fights, love, moments we can’t forget.
    Things changed, things didn’t.<br><br>

    What stayed with us till now is love.<br><br>

    This 7th month I want us to grow emotionally,
    mentally and as individuals. We are one right?<br><br>

    I still remember the day I proposed.
    I love you a lot baby.
